#simple shell project
On this project we tried to emulate a real shell and handle most of its operation

It works by passing arguments through CLI or in an interactive mode.

We implemented a built in, env and exit functionality
Where env prints the current environment variables and exit terminates the shell.

It also handles PATH and handle errors.
